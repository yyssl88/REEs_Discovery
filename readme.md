# REE Discovery
This project studies two questions about rule discovery. Can we
characterize the usefulness of rules using quantitative criteria? How
can we discover rules using those criteria? As a testbed, we consider
entity enhancing rules (REEs), which subsume common association
rules and data quality rules as special cases. We characterize REEs
using a bi-criteria model, with both objective measures such as
support and confidence, and subjective measures for the user‚Äôs
needs; we learn the subjective measure and the weight vectors via
active learning. Based on the bi-criteria model, we develop a top-ùëò
algorithm to discover top-ranked REEs, and an any-time algorithm
for successive discovery via lazy evaluation. 

For more details, see the **Discovering Top-k Rules using Subjective and Objective Criteria** paper. 

The codes mainly include two parts:
1. mls-server: rule discovery;  
2. REEs_model: interestingness model;  

## Installation
Before building the projects, the following prerequisites need to be installed:
* Java JDK 1.8
* Maven ---
* 

## REEs_model
--- The source code of dynamic predicate filtering and rule interestingness

## mls-server    
This code is for REEs discovery.
Below we give a toy example.

1. Put the datasets into HDFS:
```
hdfs dfs -put airports.csv /data_path/
```
2. Then revise the data path in code:
```
set the path of line 2004 in src/main/java/sics/seiois/mlsserver/biz/mock/RuleFindRequestMock.java to be hdfs:///data_path/airports.csv
```
3. Put the files related to interestingness model, from datasets/, into HDFS:
```
hdfs dfs mkdir -p /tmp/rulefind/interestingness/airports_topk/
hdfs dfs -put tokenVobs.txt /tmp/rulefind/interestingness/airports_topk/
hdfs dfs -put interestingnessModel.txt /tmp/rulefind/interestingness/airports_topk/
hdfs dfs -put filterRegressionModel.txt /tmp/rulefind/interestingness/airports_topk/
hdfs dfs -put airports_predicates.txt /tmp/rulefind/interestingness/airports_topk/
```
4. Download all the dependencies from Google Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xup0eVNB84BgJz3GSrFCy9X_bG2GF8Lm?usp=sharing, then move the directory lib/ into mls-server/example/:
```
cd mls-server/
mv lib/ example/
```
5. Compile and build the project:
```
mvn package
```
Then move and replace the **mls-server-0.1.1.jar** from mls-server/target/ to example/lib/:
```
mv target/mls_server-0.1.1.jar example/lib/
```
5. After all these preparation, run the toy example:
```
cd example/scripts/
./discovery.sh
```
The results will be shown in discoveryResults/, as 'resRootFile' in run_unit.sh shows.

## Datasets
Only contain a small dataset Airport.
